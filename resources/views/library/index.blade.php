                        Today I am sharing the best java books to learn java programming.
                        Java is one of the most widely used programming languages.
                        You will find java based applications everywhere, from embedded systems to web applications.
                        Android programming is built on top of java, that is used in billions of smartphones, tablets etc.
                        So if you want to build your career as a Java professional,
                        having good core java knowledge is a must. If you are good at Core Java,
                        learning all other java based frameworks is not that hard. That’s why,
                        even after working in IT industry for 10 years and using several Java,
                        Java EE frameworks; I value Core Java most.
